        <div class="part-title">Part One — The Place Where Silence Learns Your Name</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Evening did not arrive loudly it slipped into the room like a secret that had waited too long to be told the sky slowly lost its color blue turning into something tired and unsure as if it too was carrying a memory it could not release</div>

        <div class="paragraph">The city outside continued breathing lights blinking without emotion streets moving without meaning people passing with lives that did not touch his and inside the small room on the fourth floor a man sat quietly learning once again how to be alone</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Adrian leaned against the wall its cold pressing gently into his back as if reminding him that some things still existed even when warmth did not the room held the smell of old pages and forgotten hours books lay scattered like unfinished thoughts their open mouths unable to speak anymore</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Silence lived there now not the peaceful kind but the heavy kind that listens the kind that remembers</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Once this room had known another rhythm soft footsteps shared breathing two cups placed too close on a table as if afraid of distance laughter that did not try to impress a voice that said his name like it mattered</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Now silence had taken that voice and learned how to imitate it</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Adrian closed his eyes and in the darkness behind them memory began to move not loudly not clearly but faithfully</div>

        <div class="paragraph">He remembered how love had not ended in fire not in shouting or broken doors not in dramatic last words it had ended the way light leaves a room slowly politely without asking permission</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Love had simply grown quieter until one day he realized he was listening to echoes</div>

        <div class="paragraph">Outside the rain kept falling inside the shadow of love stretched gently across the floor not to hurt him not to leave him but to remind him that once something real had chosen to stay</div>
